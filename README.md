# RealmSpeak
RealmSpeak is a java application that allows you to play Avalon Hill's Magic Realm the boardgame online with friends,
or as a solitaire game.

Look in the Documents subfolder for instructions about getting it all to build through "ant".
Once you have ant and a java JDK installed, it's a simple two commands to get the RealmSpeakFull.jar.
Copy the libraries (only once required). Then you just click run.bat.
Not a good way to modify RealmSpeak, but a great way to get the final product when you are done debugging.

To understand all the dependencies, take a look at the file build/project-list.xml. Scroll to the very bottom,
and note the project "RealmSpeakFull". This is RealmSpeak in all it's glory! You should be able to work backward
from that to figure out how to setup projects in your favorite IDE.

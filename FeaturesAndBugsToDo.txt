---:::IDEAS:::---
Character abilities:
	Cannot initiate attacks on natives (i.e. can only target battling natives)
	Fatigue MAGIC to reduce speed on one MOVE chit
	Cannot attack from hidden
Would be nice to make weapon abilities too:
	Immobilizing - When it hits all attacks undercut
	Stunning - Target cannot play an attack next round

Would like an API for generating a game summary:  without all the nitty gritty details, but still enough info to summarize the game.
	- Need to track options setup
	- Need to track character starts
		- VPs chosen
		- Starting dwelling
		- Starting inventory/spells/gold
	- Need to track events
		- Clearing moved to each day (if move)
		- Discoveries made
		- Treasures found
		- Combats fought
	/* Generate a home page that shows a link to the detail log, and possibly a list of days...
	 * 	- Clicking a day shows a new page with links:
	 * 		- Map
	 * 		- Characters
	 * 		- Treasure setup card
	 * 
	 * Problems:
	 * - Map doesn't change??
	 * - Controlled monsters don't appear!

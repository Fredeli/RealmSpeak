	Stunning - Target cannot play an attack next round

Would like an API for generating a game summary:  without all the nitty gritty details, but still enough info to summarize the game.
	- Need to track options setup
	- Need to track character starts
		- VPs chosen
		- Starting dwelling
		- Starting inventory/spells/gold
	- Need to track events
		- Clearing moved to each day (if move)
		- Discoveries made
		- Treasures found
		- Combats fought
	/* Generate a home page that shows a link to the detail log, and possibly a list of days...
	 * 	- Clicking a day shows a new page with links:
	 * 		- Map
	 * 		- Characters
	 * 		- Treasure setup card
	 * 
	 * Problems:
	 * - Map doesn't change??
	 * - Controlled monsters don't appear!

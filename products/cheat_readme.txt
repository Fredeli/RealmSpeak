IF you want to run RealmSpeak with cheat mode turned ON (useful for reproducing problems you may have seen, or for getting around something RealmSpeak didn't let you do that you think it should have), start with this script:

	cheat.bat  (windows users)

If you are a non-Windows user, you simply need put the word "CHEAT" as an argument to the java launch command, like this:

	javaw -mx384m -cp mail.jar:activation.jar:RealmSpeak.jar com.robin.magic_realm.RealmSpeak.RealmSpeakFrame CHEAT

Once cheat mode is enabled, you will be able to access the cheat dialog by clicking on the character token/name on the character frame (not the map!).  You know, the window that shows your character, click on the token next to the name of your character.

Once you do that, a dialog will appear.  Type "help" (without the quotes) in the dialog, and it will give you list of ALL the commands you can use to cheat.

For example, type "manifest", and you'll see where EVERY item in the game is currently located (even those you haven't yet seen).  Type "seeall", and you'll get to see every dwelling and treasure site, to see what they contain.  Type "Giant Bat", and a Giant Bat will appear in your clearing.

Some things to note:

1)	There is no error feedback, so if you type something wrong, it wont tell you anything is wrong.
2)	Cheat codes are case-sensitive.  If you type "giant bat" instead of "Giant Bat", it will not work
3)	You must know the case-sensitive name of a treasure to get it - one easy way to see what it is, is to type "manifest", and find it in the resulting list.
4)	Once you use cheat mode, your character will be tagged with the word "Cheater" for the remainder of the game.  If you don't like that, then don't cheat.

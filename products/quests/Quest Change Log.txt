Version 2020-12-07

New All-Play Random Events:

--Fog - random tiles will become fogged in, making PEER unavailable.
--Violent Storm - sometimes a tile will be ravaged by a violent storm and you will lose phases if caught out in the open.
--Lost - sometimes you will get lost and have your move overriden with a random move. This only happens if you're not at a landmark like a site or dwelling and you're alone on the tile.
--Lightning Strike - if you are in the mountains during stormy seasons with stormy weather, there is a chance of being struck by lightning. The odds increase depending on how much metal you are carrying. This is not the Lightning Bolt spell, but a mimic of it.
--Hurricane Winds - If you are in the mountains there is a chance of a gust of wind blowing you off the mountain.
--Roof Collapses - this is another mimic rather than a spell. In this case, it triggers randomly when a T monster is fighting in a cave, supposedly because the monster is too large for the confined space. Possible random outcomes are: 1) you get wounded by falling rock (might become unhidden), 2) you get fatigued from dodging a falling rock (might become unhidden), 3) you become hidden by taking cover behind falling rock, 4) the monster becomes buried by falling rock, 5) you use the falling rock for a tactical advantage and can change your move > 3, 6) no effect, battle continues.

New NPC "Visitors":

--Armorer - a less than honest shopkeeper in the woods will buy, sell, and repair, armor and bladed weapons at outrageous prices.
--Old Hag - a woman who lives in a remote location who sells potions for a price.
--Cave Miner - a stranger who will offer to guide you in caves (extra phase) for gold.
--Mountain Hermit: a stranger who will offer to guide you in mountains (-1 move cost) for gold.
--Frontier Healer - a woman who moves from dwelling to dwelling healing fatigue/wounds for gold.
--Monastery - a place high in the mountains where monks will offer services for a donation: 1) small blessings, 2) consult the oracle (wise bird), 3) make whole, 4) train to be a warrior monk (give up all your worldly possessions for extreme skill boost).

New All Play Quest:

* Winged Steed - Control a Giant Bat if you possess the Battle Bracelets.

* Cloven Hoof - possess the cloven hoof and control spiders and octopus. However, you will get the +1 penalty on all rolls while possessing it. I tried to entice the player to not throw it away.

New Event Cards:

* Given Up For Dead - Avoid certain death.

* Find a Side Path - Cross roads in valleys.

* Hidden Trail - Cross roads in woods.

New Hand Quests:

* The Zoological Specimen - Transport a T monster back to town.

==========================================================================

Version 2020.10.11

* Renumbered quests.

* First to Discover quests:

These quests have been revised to be "First to Tell of Discovery" quests. Each site discovery now has a choice of native groups to tell. The character has to return to a dwelling with a designated native HQ present and spend the evening. The quest can be activated at Birdsong to claim the points. The native group will increase friendliness for being told of the discovery, and jealous rivals will lose friendliness. Edits were added to test activation requirements.

* Mapmaker Quests:

Added second native locations that offer more money but no fame.

* You Are... quests:

The original victory point quests have been changed to require Birdsong activation, as well as having a native present at the dwelling. Validation steps have been added to enforce the requirements.

* Meet a Visitor quests:

Edits added to prevent activation if the visitor is not present.

* Joins You quests:

Most of these quests were changed to give the companions goals (e.g., # of kills, travel to location). When the goals are reached, the companion will leave you. This has three effects: 1) You will eventually lose the companion, and 2) the quest remains occupying a card slot until the goal is reached, preventing cycling through quests, and 3) awards a Quest Point at completion.

* Find Weapons quests:

Changed to only activate at Birdsong.

--Eerie Lights, Easy Roads changed to Birdsong activation, one additional day.
--Renewed Strength - gives extra rest.

THIS README is for MAC USERS ONLY

Put the RealmSpeak.jar file into the folder where you unzipped the RealmSpeak Resource Pack.

The folder contents should contain:

     /images
     RealmSpeak.jar
     mail.jar
     activation.jar

If the RealmSpeak.jar is not at the same level as the images folder, it will not work correctly!  (Someday I'll get an installer together, to make this a bit more user friendly!)

Unpack the MacRealmSpeak.zip archive, and move the three applescript files to the same level as the RealmSpeak.jar file.  Double-click the appropriate script (one launches the game, one launches the battle simulator, and one launches the character builder), and the game should start.  Do not click the RealmSpeak.jar file directly anymore - memory doesn't get set up properly if you do this.

If the batch file does something unexpected, you may need to get the latest version of Java.

THIS README is for LINUX USERS ONLY

Unpack the LinuxRealmSpeak.zip archive, and move the files to the same level as the RealmSpeakFull.jar file.  Make sure the scripts are executable:

	chmod 744 runlinux
	chmod 744 runlinux-battle
	chmod 744 runlinux-charbuild
	chmod 744 runlinux-cheat
	chmod 744 runlinux-gm
	chmod 744 runlinux-questbuild

To start RealmSpeak, simply launch the appropriate script.  For example:

	./runlinux

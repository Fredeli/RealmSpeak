Put all of the jar files into the folder where you unzipped the RealmSpeak Resource Pack.

The folder contents should be:

/images
RealmSpeak.jar
mail.jar
activation.jar

If the jar files are not at the same level as the images folder, it will not work correctly!  (Someday I'll get an installer together, to make this a bit more user friendly!)

When you are ready to play, double-click the appropriate batch file:

	run.bat		- Play the game
	runHere.bat	- Play the game, but keep all configurations/Hall of Fame in the same directory
	cheat.bat	- Play the game, with cheating enabled (see cheat.txt)
	battle.bat	- Launch the battle editor

If you are a Mac user, unpack the MacRealmSpeak.zip, and use the AppleScript files therein.

Do not click the RealmSpeak.jar file directly anymore - memory doesn't get set up properly if you do this, and you WILL get an error.

If the batch file does something unexpected, you may need to download the Java Runtime from:

	http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Make sure you get the "JRE 6u1" or later.  At this writing, the link is the fourth one down on the page, titled "Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6u1".  Note that the "u1" indicates a version, and it will likely change to u2, and u3 in the future.  As long as you have 6u1 or greater, you'll be fine.

Run the installer you downloaded, and Java will be installed.  Now you should be able to run RealmSpeak.

Of course, I'm always available at robin@dewkid.com if you need any help.

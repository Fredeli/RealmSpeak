THIS README is for LINUX USERS ONLY

Put the RealmSpeak.jar file into the folder where you unzipped the RealmSpeak Resource Pack.

The folder contents should contain:

/images
RealmSpeak.jar
mail.jar
activation.jar

If the RealmSpeak.jar is not at the same level as the images folder, it will not work correctly!  (Someday I'll get an installer together, to make this a bit more user friendly!)

Unpack the LinuxRealmSpeak.zip archive, and move the files to the same level as the RealmSpeak.jar file.  Make sure the scripts are executable:

	chmod 744 runlinux
	chmod 744 runlinux-battle
	chmod 744 runlinux-charbuild
	chmod 744 runlinux-cheat
	chmod 744 runlinux-gm

To start RealmSpeak, simply launch the appropriate script.  For example:

	./runlinux

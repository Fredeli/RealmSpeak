Version 2020.10.11

* Renumbered quests.

* First to Discover quests:

These quests have been revised to be "First to Tell of Discovery" quests. Each site discovery now has a choice of native groups to tell. The character has to return to a dwelling with a designated native HQ present and spend the evening. The quest can be activated at Birdsong to claim the points. The native group will increase friendliness for being told of the discovery, and jealous rivals will lose friendliness. Edits were added to test activation requirements.

* Mapmaker Quests:

Added second native locations that offer more money but no fame.

* You Are... quests:

The original victory point quests have been changed to require Birdsong activation, as well as having a native present at the dwelling. Validation steps have been added to enforce the requirements.

* Meet a Visitor quests:

Edits added to prevent activation if the visitor is not present.

* Joins You quests:

Most of these quests were changed to give the companions goals (e.g., # of kills, travel to location). When the goals are reached, the companion will leave you. This has three effects: 1) You will eventually lose the companion, and 2) the quest remains occupying a card slot until the goal is reached, preventing cycling through quests, and 3) awards a Quest Point at completion.

Changed to only activate at Birdsong.

Custom Character Saving/Loading
	A GameData file will be saved, along with necessary images
	Character rschar files will be dropped into the custom folder, and RealmSpeak will know how to handle them.
		When RealmSpeak launches, it should look in the custom folder for any character file, and stuff the images (tokens, weapons, and badges) into ImageCache
		When RealmComponent creates a CharacterChitToken, it should make sure the images it needs is there
			Yes - good to go
			No - a message should pop up informing the user that the character isn't properly installed

Custom advantages to do:
	Easy
	Medium
		cannot initiate attacks on natives (ie., can only target battling natives)
	Harder
		L and M monsters are FRIENDLY and hireable
		Monster immunity (specific) - should fix demon immunity to be a bit more generalized
		Fatigue MAGIC to reduce speed on one MOVE chit
		Cast a permanent spell (like prophecy) at the start (others?)
		cannot attack from hidden
		can play TWO fights, each with a weapon (can have two weapons active...)
		
Would be nice to make weapon abilities too:
	Immobilizing - When it hits all attacks undercut
	Stunning - Target cannot play an attack next round
